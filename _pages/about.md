I am currently a PhD student from University of California Santa Cruz Silicon Valley Extension major in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) following [Prof. Ian Lane](https://ucsc-ai.github.io/member/ian/), focusing on **multimodal conversational interaction, turn-taking models, LLM hallucination detection, speech processing, and natural language processing**. 

Previously I was a graduate student from [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) major in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), and an undergraduate student from [Duke Kunshan University](https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/en/about) major in Data Science.
I joined [SMIIP Lab](https://sites.duke.edu/dkusmiip/) led by my research
mentor [Prof. Ming Li](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/MingLi) since the summer of my freshman year.

I have wide research interests in **speech analysis**, and especially focuses on **Target Speech Separation (TSS)**
task. It is the task which only extracts target speaker's voice from the mixed utterance.

I also have interests in mathematics, statistics, mathematical modeling.
